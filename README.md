Projecr 2 - Words In Motion

by Nathan Siu

# project overview
Exploring the concept of community, choose a text and create an interactive experience using advanced CSS. The chosen text can be a poem, or song lyrics that relate to the concept of community.

The song that I've chosen is You've Got A Friend In Me by Randy Newman.

# technical overview
For this project, text is layed out using HTML and then styled using CSS. Each page has animations and transitions that are created using CSS techniques like animation duration, animation timing, key frames, etc. All pages are connected to each other through relative links on specific words, that when clicked, redirects to the subsequent page.
