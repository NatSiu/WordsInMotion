Projecr 2 - Words In Motion

# project overview
Exploring the concept of community, choose a text and create an interactive experience using advanced CSS. The chosen text can be a poem, or song lyrics that relate to the concept of community.

The song that I've chosen is You've Got A Friend In Me by Randy Newman. I chose this song because it relates to my idea of what community is. The song mentions multiple times about being there for someone when they need help. To me, community is made up of friends and family. Whenever we feel down, or are in a rough spot, our community is always there to pick us up and help us through difficult times. They are people that we can rely on. For the background, I chose a soft color to match the positivity and softness of the lyrics. For the font choice, I chose a font that felt handwritten to give off a more personal feel. I also chose it because of the friendly characteristics of the font like the loops in some of the letters.

# technical overview
For this project, text is layed out using HTML and then styled using CSS. Each page has animations and transitions that are created using CSS techniques like animation duration, animation timing, key frames, etc. All pages are connected to each other through relative links on specific words, that when clicked, redirects to the subsequent page.
