			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			When the road looks rough ahead
			<br>
			And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
			<br>
			You just remember what your old pal said
			<br>
			Boy, you've got a friend in me
			<br>
			Yeah, you've got a friend in me
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			You've got troubles, and I've got 'em, too
			<br>
			There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
			<br>
			We stick together and we see it through
			<br>
			'Cause you've got a friend in me
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
			<br>
			Bigger and stronger too, maybe
			<br>
			But none of them will ever love you the way I do
			<br>
			It's me and you, boy
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			And as the years go by
			<br>
			Our friendship will never die
			<br>
			You're gonna see, it's our destiny
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			We stick together and we see it through
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
			<br>
			You've got a friend in me
		</p>
